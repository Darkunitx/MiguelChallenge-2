# My Portfolio

## Description 
- I have created this portfolio to help further my web developing skills and to show potential hiree seeking companies what i am truly capable of. This Portfolio will help companies understand me and it will make it easier for others to find my work and how to contact me. I've learnt a ton of CSS especially the usage of flex box and making sure that my website works with all sorts of devices/screens.
